# Ansible Learning Notes

This repository contains my learning notes for Ansible, a popular open-source automation tool. I have used the following sources:

## Udemy online courses:
- Ansible for the Absolute Beginner - Hands-On - DevOps
- Dive Into Ansible - Beginner to Expert in Ansible - DevOps

In addition to the Udemy courses I am using, there are many other resources available for learning Ansible. Here are a few that I recommend:

Ansible Documentation: https://docs.ansible.com/
Ansible Community Portal: https://www.ansible.com/community
Ansible Galaxy: https://galaxy.ansible.com/

## Feedback
I am still learning Ansible, and I welcome any feedback on my notes. Please feel free to open an issue or pull request on this repository.
